# when running assembly from the "run" button, the machine code box does not get filled.  
# only gets filled when using the "step" button

# need to update docs to reflect changes
# need to get Mark's code added and see how its all going to fit together

# can we use a table instead of calculating the values on the wires every time?

# when running assembly command LW and SW the correct values are not displayed on the stack.
